      summary: Price Stream
      description: >-
        Get a stream of Account Prices starting from when the request is made.

        This pricing stream does not include every single price created for the
        Account, but instead will provide at most 4 prices per second (every 250
        milliseconds) for each instrument being requested.

        If more than one price is created for an instrument during the 250
        millisecond window, only the price in effect at the end of the window is
        sent. This means that during periods of rapid price movement,
        subscribers to this stream will not be sent every price.

        Pricing windows for different connections to the price stream are not
        all aligned in the same way (i.e. they are not all aligned to the top of
        the second). This means that during periods of rapid price movement,
        different subscribers may observe different prices depending on their
        alignment.

      or inverse (ask for sell, bid for buy) price depending on the desired
      behaviour. Orders are always filled using their default price component.

      This feature is only provided through the REST API. Clients who choose to
      specify a non-default trigger condition will not see it reflected in any
      of OANDA's proprietary or partner trading platforms, their transaction
      history or their account statements. OANDA platforms always assume that an
      Order's trigger condition is set to the default value when indicating the
      distance from an Order's trigger price, and will always provide the
      default trigger condition when creating or modifying an Order.

      A special restriction applies when creating a guaranteed Stop Loss Order.
      In this case the TriggerCondition value must either be "DEFAULT", or the
      "natural" trigger side "DEFAULT" results in. So for a Stop Loss Order for
      a long trade valid values are "DEFAULT" and "BID", and for short trades
      "DEFAULT" and "ASK" are valid.

          sell) or inverse (ask for sell, bid for buy) price depending on the
          desired behaviour. Orders are always filled using their default price
          component.

          This feature is only provided through the REST API. Clients who choose
          to specify a non-default trigger condition will not see it reflected
          in any of OANDA's proprietary or partner trading platforms, their
          transaction history or their account statements. OANDA platforms
          always assume that an Order's trigger condition is set to the default
          value when indicating the distance from an Order's trigger price, and
          will always provide the default trigger condition when creating or
          modifying an Order.

          A special restriction applies when creating a guaranteed Stop Loss
          Order. In this case the TriggerCondition value must either be
          "DEFAULT", or the "natural" trigger side "DEFAULT" results in. So for
          a Stop Loss Order for a long trade valid values are "DEFAULT" and
          "BID", and for short trades "DEFAULT" and "ASK" are valid.

          The RFC 3339 representation is a string conforming to
          https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt. The Unix representation is a
          string representing the number of seconds since the Unix Epoch
          (January 1st, 1970 at UTC). The value is a fractional number, where
          the fractional part represents a fraction of a second (up to nine
          decimal places).
      triggerCondition:
        type: string
        description: >-
          Specification of which price component should be used when determining
          if an Order should be triggered and filled. This allows Orders to be
          triggered based on the bid, ask, mid, default (ask for buy, bid for
          sell) or inverse (ask for sell, bid for buy) price depending on the
          desired behaviour. Orders are always filled using their default price
          component.

          This feature is only provided through the REST API. Clients who choose
          to specify a non-default trigger condition will not see it reflected
          in any of OANDA's proprietary or partner trading platforms, their
          transaction history or their account statements. OANDA platforms
          always assume that an Order's trigger condition is set to the default
          value when indicating the distance from an Order's trigger price, and
          will always provide the default trigger condition when creating or
          modifying an Order.

          A special restriction applies when creating a guaranteed Stop Loss
          Order. In this case the TriggerCondition value must either be
          "DEFAULT", or the "natural" trigger side "DEFAULT" results in. So for
          a Stop Loss Order for a long trade valid values are "DEFAULT" and
          "BID", and for short trades "DEFAULT" and "ASK" are valid.
        enum:

          - INVERSE
          - BID
          - ASK

          sell) or inverse (ask for sell, bid for buy) price depending on the
          desired behaviour. Orders are always filled using their default price
          component.

          This feature is only provided through the REST API. Clients who choose
          to specify a non-default trigger condition will not see it reflected
          in any of OANDA's proprietary or partner trading platforms, their
          transaction history or their account statements. OANDA platforms
          always assume that an Order's trigger condition is set to the default
          value when indicating the distance from an Order's trigger price, and
          will always provide the default trigger condition when creating or
          modifying an Order.

          A special restriction applies when creating a guaranteed Stop Loss
          Order. In this case the TriggerCondition value must either be
          "DEFAULT", or the "natural" trigger side "DEFAULT" results in. So for
          a Stop Loss Order for a long trade valid values are "DEFAULT" and
          "BID", and for short trades "DEFAULT" and "ASK" are valid.

        description: >-
          Specification of which price component should be used when determining
          if an Order should be triggered and filled. This allows Orders to be
          triggered based on the bid, ask, mid, default (ask for buy, bid for
          sell) or inverse (ask for sell, bid for buy) price depending on the
          desired behaviour. Orders are always filled using their default price
          component.

          This feature is only provided through the REST API. Clients who choose
          to specify a non-default trigger condition will not see it reflected
          in any of OANDA's proprietary or partner trading platforms, their
          transaction history or their account statements. OANDA platforms
          always assume that an Order's trigger condition is set to the default
          value when indicating the distance from an Order's trigger price, and
          will always provide the default trigger condition when creating or
          modifying an Order.

          A special restriction applies when creating a guaranteed Stop Loss
          Order. In this case the TriggerCondition value must either be
          "DEFAULT", or the "natural" trigger side "DEFAULT" results in. So for
          a Stop Loss Order for a long trade valid values are "DEFAULT" and
          "BID", and for short trades "DEFAULT" and "ASK" are valid.

          The RFC 3339 representation is a string conforming to
          https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt. The Unix representation is a

          (January 1st, 1970 at UTC). The value is a fractional number, where
          the fractional part represents a fraction of a second (up to nine

          Specification of which price component should be used when determining

          sell) or inverse (ask for sell, bid for buy) price depending on the
          desired behaviour. Orders are always filled using their default price
          component.

          This feature is only provided through the REST API. Clients who choose
          to specify a non-default trigger condition will not see it reflected
          in any of OANDA's proprietary or partner trading platforms, their
          transaction history or their account statements. OANDA platforms
          always assume that an Order's trigger condition is set to the default
          value when indicating the distance from an Order's trigger price, and
          will always provide the default trigger condition when creating or
          modifying an Order.

          A special restriction applies when creating a guaranteed Stop Loss
          Order. In this case the TriggerCondition value must either be
          "DEFAULT", or the "natural" trigger side "DEFAULT" results in. So for
          a Stop Loss Order for a long trade valid values are "DEFAULT" and
          "BID", and for short trades "DEFAULT" and "ASK" are valid.

          sell) or inverse (ask for sell, bid for buy) price depending on the
          desired behaviour. Orders are always filled using their default price
          component.

          This feature is only provided through the REST API. Clients who choose
          to specify a non-default trigger condition will not see it reflected
          in any of OANDA's proprietary or partner trading platforms, their
          transaction history or their account statements. OANDA platforms
          always assume that an Order's trigger condition is set to the default
          value when indicating the distance from an Order's trigger price, and
          will always provide the default trigger condition when creating or
          modifying an Order.

          A special restriction applies when creating a guaranteed Stop Loss
          Order. In this case the TriggerCondition value must either be
          "DEFAULT", or the "natural" trigger side "DEFAULT" results in. So for
          a Stop Loss Order for a long trade valid values are "DEFAULT" and
          "BID", and for short trades "DEFAULT" and "ASK" are valid.

          The RFC 3339 representation is a string conforming to

          string representing the number of seconds since the Unix Epoch
          (January 1st, 1970 at UTC). The value is a fractional number, where

      triggerCondition:

        description: >-
          Specification of which price component should be used when determining
          if an Order should be triggered and filled. This allows Orders to be
          triggered based on the bid, ask, mid, default (ask for buy, bid for
          sell) or inverse (ask for sell, bid for buy) price depending on the
          desired behaviour. Orders are always filled using their default price
          component.

          This feature is only provided through the REST API. Clients who choose
          to specify a non-default trigger condition will not see it reflected
          in any of OANDA's proprietary or partner trading platforms, their
          transaction history or their account statements. OANDA platforms
          always assume that an Order's trigger condition is set to the default
          value when indicating the distance from an Order's trigger price, and
          will always provide the default trigger condition when creating or
          modifying an Order.

          A special restriction applies when creating a guaranteed Stop Loss
          Order. In this case the TriggerCondition value must either be
          "DEFAULT", or the "natural" trigger side "DEFAULT" results in. So for
          a Stop Loss Order for a long trade valid values are "DEFAULT" and
          "BID", and for short trades "DEFAULT" and "ASK" are valid.
